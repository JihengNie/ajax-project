# Card Thief

A web application built with HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that utilizes data obtained by the YGOPRODeck API to generate an overall deck cost.

## Why I Built This

I chose this project to improve upon my front-end development skills, particularly responsive design, DOM manipulation, CSS styling/transitions, and JavaScript data manipulation. As a life-long fan of Yu-Gi-Oh, I found this project to be a wonderful development experience, as I got to create an interactive and visual display of one of my favorite games of all time.

## Technologies Used
